# Angular 2: Authentication sample.

This sample shows how to create an angular 2 app that:
* Has **lots of different routes**
* Performs **authentication with Custom Authentications**
* **Calls APIs** authenticated and not.
* Extends the **RouterOutlet** for route pipeline changes.

## Running it

First, run the server app in the port `3002`.

Then, run `npm install` on this project and run `npm start` to start the app. Then just navigate to [http://localhost:3002](http://localhost:3002) :boom:
